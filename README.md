**Objective**   
---   
The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias in data using Wikipedia articles. This assignment will consider articles about cities in different US states. For this assignment, you will combine a dataset of Wikipedia articles with a dataset of state populations, and use a machine learning service called ORES to estimate the quality of the articles about the cities.

# Objective  
---  
In this study, I delved into the examination of bias within data by utilizing Wikipedia articles. I obtained data pertaining to searches for Wikipedia articles about various cities and towns throughout the United States, and I assessed the articles' quality using the ORES API. I conducted an analysis of significant metrics associated with the predicted article quality, such as identifying the states with the most comprehensive per capita coverage of articles. The primary objective was to gain insights into the regional patterns of article coverage and the prevalence of high-quality articles.
