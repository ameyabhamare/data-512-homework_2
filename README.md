The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias in data using Wikipedia articles. This assignment will consider articles about cities in different US states. For this assignment, you will combine a dataset of Wikipedia articles with a dataset of state populations, and use a machine learning service called ORES to estimate the quality of the articles about the cities.

# Goal of the Project    
---  
In this project, I explore the concept of bias in data using Wikipedia articles. I try to acquire data relating to Wikipedia article searches for some cities/towns across the US and what the quality of the Wikipedia articles for these cities is. I also try to analyze some important metrics corresponding to the predicted quality, such as the states with best per capita coverage of articles. The aim is to understand the statewise trends in article coverage/presence of high quality articles.
