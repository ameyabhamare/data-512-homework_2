The graphs folder contains all required graphs - 
* 1_page_requests_graph.png
* 2_top_articles_page_views_graph.png 
* 3_fewest_months_data_graph.png

The json_files folder contains the 3 json files - 
* academy_monthly_mobile_201507-202309.json
* academy_monthly_desktop_201507-202309.json
* academy_monthly_cumulative_201507-202309.json

An example row in the json file - 
[{"12 Years a Slave (film)": [{"project": "en.wikipedia", "granularity": "monthly", "timestamp": "2015070100", "views": 138151}, {"project": "en.wikipedia", "granularity": "monthly", "timestamp": "2015080100", "views": 122993}, {}]

The data structure is a list of dictionaries (outer is for article level) within a list of dictionaries (inner is the time series data for each article)

Here, project is the name of the project, granulairty refers to the time duration for which web traffic is montiored, timestamp is a YYYYMMDD00 format, agent refers to who accessed it and views is the number of monthly visits.
